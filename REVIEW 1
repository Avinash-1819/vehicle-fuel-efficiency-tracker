1. Project Overview

-> Fuel Efficiency Tracker is a console-based Java application that helps users:
-> Manage vehicles
-> Record trips
-> Monitor fuel usage
-> Calculate fuel efficiency

2. Features

1. Add multiple vehicles with name, type, and fuel details
2. Record trips including distance traveled and fuel consumed
3. Refill fuel for vehicles
4. View vehicle details, trip logs, and fuel efficiency
5. Monitor the most efficient vehicle among all
6. Background fuel monitoring using a thread to warn if fuel is low
7. Exception handling for insufficient fuel scenarios

3. Core Java Concepts Implemented
-> Concept	Implementation
-> Classes & Objects	Vehicle, Trip, FuelMonitor, FuelEfficiencyTracker
-> Collections	ArrayList to store trips, HashMap to store vehicles
-> Thread	FuelMonitor runs in background to monitor fuel levels
-> Custom Exception	InsufficientFuelException with try-catch blocks
4. Installation & Setup

-> Install Java JDK (version 8 or above)
-> Clone or download the repository
-> Open terminal or command prompt
-> Navigate to the folder containing FuelEfficiencyTracker.java

5. How to Use
      Menu Options:

            -> Add a new vehicle
            -> Record a trip for a vehicle
            -> Refill fuel for a vehicle
            -> View details of vehicles and trips
            -> Show the most fuel-efficient vehicle
            -> Exit the application
            -> Input values as prompted for fuel, distance, or price
            -> Watch console for low-fuel warnings triggered by the background thread

6. Steps Demonstrated

-> Add vehicles with name, type, and fuel capacity
-> Refill vehicle fuel and track total fuel used
-> Record trips with distance and fuel used
-> Display trip details and calculate efficiency for each trip
-> Track overall efficiency for each vehicle
-> Monitor vehicles in background for low fuel using threads
-> Handle exceptions if a trip uses more fuel than available
