1. Project Description

    -> Vehicles
    -> Trips
    -> Fuel efficiency

2. Features

    1. Add vehicles with type selection: CAR, BIKE, TRUCK
    2. Record trips with distance and fuel used
    3. Refill fuel and track total consumption and price per litre
    4. Display trips and calculate individual & overall efficiency
    5. Show most fuel-efficient vehicle
    6. Background fuel monitoring thread
    7. Exception handling for insufficient fuel


3. Classes and Their Responsibilities

    -> Class Name	Responsibility
    -> Vehicle	Stores vehicle details, trips, fuel info, efficiency
    -> Trip	Represents a single trip with distance and fuel used
    -> FuelMonitor	Thread to monitor fuel levels in background
    -> InsufficientFuelException	Custom exception for insufficient fuel
    -> FuelEfficiencyTracker	Main class with console menu and flow

4. Collections Used

    -> ArrayList<Trip> → Stores trips for each vehicle
    -> ArrayList<Vehicle> → Stores all vehicles
    -> HashMap<String, Vehicle> → Quick access to vehicles by name

5. Thread Usage
    -> FuelMonitor thread checks if a vehicle’s fuel is below 5 liters
    -> Each vehicle added starts a new monitoring thread

6. Custom Exception Handling

    -> InsufficientFuelException is thrown if a trip exceeds available fuel
    -> Handled using try-catch blocks to avoid program crash

7. Installation Steps

    -> Ensure Java JDK is installed
    -> Download or clone the repository
    -> Open terminal/command prompt
    -> Navigate to the folder containing FuelEfficiencyTracker.java

Compile program:
javac FuelEfficiencyTracker.java

Run program:
java FuelEfficiencyTracker

8. Usage Instructions

    Run the program and select menu options:
    
    1. Add Vehicle
    
    2. Record Trip
    
    3. Refill Fuel
    
    4. View Vehicle Details
    
    5. Show Most Efficient Vehicle
    
    6. Exit

Enter numeric values as prompted

Low-fuel warnings appear automatically from the background thread

Trip efficiencies and vehicle summaries are displayed in tabular format
